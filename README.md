# Panacea: A Model-Based Framework for Self-Protecting Systems
The goal of this research is threefold:

(i) to create an explainable anomaly-based IDS for a large-scale computer system, where each element (i.e., hardware or software
component): (a) has an autonomous behavior described by a multi-variate time series with different sampling rates; (b) operates
according to possibly unknown conditions;
(ii) to create a robust, scalable and multi-agent Intrusion Response System that: (a) is based on a joint model of defender and
attacker; (b) guarantees robustness with respect to model changes;
(iii) to create the first publicly available testbed for the validation of Self-Protecting Systems.

The research work proposed herein is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide an integrated approach to self-protection,
which includes both, explainable anomaly-based intrusion detection and intrusion response. The former will be based on a
distributed, hierarchical approach to multi-variate time series analysis. It will use neural network models for the local detection of
intrusions and the application of post-hoc models for providing explanations to be exploited by the intrusion response system. The
latter will be based on a stochastic game implementation relying on a Generative Adversarial Network, in order to address inherent
scalability issues of traditional reinforcement learning approaches, and in order to seamlessly deal with the non-stationary behavior
of the agents participating to the game. Furthermore, this research will address one of the main issues concerning self-protecting
systems, that is, the lack of a standardized testbed for the evaluation and the comparison of different techniques.
The proposed approach will constitute the basis for a framework to realize self-protecting systems, named Panacea. In order to
validate the proposed techniques, the latter will be instantiated on a case study for the protection of a large-scale web-based system. The selection of this type of system stems from their widespread presence, as well as from the fact that, due to the ongoing
conflicts, they are currently the main target of cyber-attacks.

The Panacea project will yield results which will advance the state of the knowledge and of engineering techniques for cyber-security
automation in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Autonomic Computing, Cyber-Security, and Big Data. More specifically, it will yield
results in the areas of Anomaly Detection, Intrusion Response, and Secure Software and Platform Engineering. The scientific results
will be disseminated to the research community, and will be used to create new course material to update the existing
cyber-security, artificial intelligence and big data curricula of undergraduate and graduate courses.
This research will lay the foundation for future application of similar techniques to other domains, including but not limited to,
systems based on the Cloud-Edge continuum, critical infrastructures, and Cyber-Physical Systems.
